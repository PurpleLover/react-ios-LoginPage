Created for Learning React Native, written and tested most on iOS. <br>
I use react-navigation for Navigation, and react-element for their Icons.<br>
There is 3 folder for the Login Page<br>
	-assets: contains image using for this<br>
	-component: splits larger file to smaller components<br>
	-scaling: calculates the layout to fit every screen, from this (https://github.com/nirsky/react-native-size-matters)<br>
Other .md files are my dump files.<br>
Forgive me for my 'noob' writing skill. I will up-to-date ASAP.
